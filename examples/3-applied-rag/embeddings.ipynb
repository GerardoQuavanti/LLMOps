Together with Pacha Ibiza’s other residents — Bedouin, Robin Schulz, Purple Disco Machine, Diplo, Hugel, Lost Frequencies and Bora Uzer — the club will be kicking off the 2024 season with a series of one-off events with, to name a few, WhoMadeWho, Ben Böhmer, Roger Sanchez, Loco Dice, Keinemusik, Kölsch and Ida Engberg, before heading into another no doubt killer summer season.
