These days it is a hotbed of electronic music activity that boasts a Funktion-One sound system and sleek visual edge designed by Mexican designer Exme. In the last year, the club — which is run entirely on recycled energy — has opened a new space next to the main room that focuses on new local talent, while international guests have included the Martinez Brothers, Paco Osuna and Carl Cox.

Rising steadily through the DJ Mag Top 100 Clubs chart since its first appearance in 2017, the venue has styled itself as a festival experience within a club, and it makes the most of the gorgeous weather, glorious sunsets and connection with nature that its outdoor setting provides. On the decks, top class EDM DJs regularly entertain a mix of dedicated locals and clued-up visitors, with appearances in 2024 from Tiësto, James Hype, Steve Aoki, John Summit, Meduza, R3HAB, Gorgon City, Mochakk, Alok, Steve Angello, CamelPhat, Yotto, Kasablanca, Vintage Culture, and Peggy Gou. Looking forward to the rest of 2024, the club remains committed to its strategy of booking big names that don’t visit Brazil very often. “Additionally, we intend to continue with some labels that were successful at the club,” the Laroc team tells us, “such as Spektrum, a night focused on psytrance, and Ame Laroc Festival in 2025, and to return with Laroc Guarujá, a club of the brand located on the coast of São Paulo.” Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.'} score: 0.3399441548524632\n",

It is one of the shining lights of its native Croatian scene and a real anchor point for many of the summer's largest and most internationally renowned festivals. Events have included collaborations with legendary Ibiza club Amnesia and festivals like Oasis, hard dance smasher Forbidden Island, Hideout, and many more. Every year, the venue looks to raise the bar in terms of the DJs it offers for standalone parties, and in the last 12 months big names like MORTEN, Cuebrick and Vize have all left their mark, while well-known regional resident DJs Lorenzo, Mike & Me and NOIDE are amongst some of those with ever-growing profiles. As well as the music, the club’s location on the famous Zrće Beach on the Island of Pag makes Noa irresistible; it is built off the beach and over the Adriatic sea, with several different dancefloors and bars, a pool, chillout cabanas, palm trees, and huge sound systems all in and amongst organic and bohemian design features. It's a perfect open-air and sun-kissed beach club, frankly, and high rollers can even pull up to it by boat.
