1	HÃ¯ Ibiza	Ibiza, Spain	5,692	hiibiza.com	What makes a great club? Show-stopping line-ups plucking from the most exciting talent of the day, mixing big-room headliners and emerging names? Pin-point-perfect audio in every corner? What about mind-blowing lighting to transport crowds into the stratosphere? And a labyrinthine layout hiding weird and wonderful elements in which to get lost, or find a pack of new friends. Maybe, itâ€™s all of the above. First opening doors onto Ibizaâ€™s legendary Playa dâ€™en Bossa strip in 2017, HÃ¯ Ibizaâ€™s inaugural two seasons catapulted the address toward the pinnacle of DJ Magâ€™s Top 100 Clubs poll. For the past three years, the venue has stood at the summit of this annual list. A non-mover now ranking at No. 1 so consistently itâ€™s getting harder and harder to work out what hasnâ€™t already been said about the fabled institute. Worldâ€™s most technologically advanced dance music destination: check. Home to the White Isleâ€™s premier-league residencies: done. A marvel of nightlife design: read it before. Any attempt to define why HÃ¯ Ibiza continues to prove so perennially popular should probably start by talking about the layout. Take the Theatre, for example. A main room inspired by Italian amphitheatres with a VIP terrace surrounding the dancefloor, here, a huge LED screen creates a fully immersive experience as sonic drama blasts from the powerhouse L-Acoustics rig. One of the finest sounding things weâ€™ve been lucky enough to experience, lasers, confetti cannons, and CO2 jets heighten the impact of every drop, breakdown and rolling drum those speakers emit. In contrast, the Club Room feels squarely aimed at the heads â€” a darker, smaller, lower-ceilinged enclave where the DJ booth sits at eye level and there are far less distractions. A venue within the venue focusing firmly on the music, effects are used to emphasise and accentuate, rather than create awe-inspiring visual spectaculars.For many, though, The Wild Corner is actually HÃ¯ Ibizaâ€™s hidden highlight, a unisex bathroom with CDJs, mixer and a ceiling illuminated in vivid colours. Itâ€™s serious yet fun, or maybe that should just be seriously fun.Back outside, The Magic Garden and Secret Garden provide respite from the chaos, places to kick back, relax and talk nonsense to anyone who will listen. Ethereal installations and luxurious teepees set the tone for these chillout oases.Each of these areas will make a huge impression in their own right, but arguably itâ€™s the way every element of the complex can be fine-tuned to suit any event that guarantees so many returning visitors. Whatever the night, whoever is playing, things will look distinct compared to 24 hours earlier.â€œOur goal is always to create the best experience possible. We put our heart and soul into making every aspect of our events special, but the key element has and always will always be our guests. Without their continued support none of this would be possible. Taking the No. 1 spot in the DJ Mag Top 100 Clubs poll was a dream from the beginning, so to have been awarded the accolade for three years in a row feels incredible,â€Â  says Yann Pissenem, founder, CEO and owner of UshuaÃ¯a Entertainment, UshuaÃ¯a Ibiza and HÃ¯ Ibiza. â€œAlongside our incredible family of headline residents, and world-first debuts from pioneering artists, this year clubbers will be able to explore the multi-room experience like never before as we embrace new technologies and showcase cutting-edge production, ensuring Ibizaâ€™s legacy as one of the top clubbing destinations in the world.â€So, what does that really mean for the standard bearer? 2024 will be the venueâ€™s longest season to date, although in many ways much is the same. HÃ¯ Ibiza remains shorthand for a one-of-a-kind 360 nightlife experience unlike anything else on the island. It still means expertly programmed sessions led by extraordinary selectors, graced by groundbreaking guests. Impromptu back-to-back sets will continue to bring unforgettable surprises. And the beloved sessions and artists who call this place home are back, for good reason. Like Black Coffee and his sell-out soirÃ©e, and Afterlife, where Tale of Usâ€™ melodic grooves form ethereal moments heightened by breathtaking imagery.David Guetta & MORTENâ€™s aptly-named Future Rave is also here again, marrying main stage tunes and warehouse noises with surrealist eye-candy. Glitterboxâ€™s colourful, unabashed celebration of upfront house and disco is another contrast. Meanwhile, Eric Prydz will present a newly updated take on his legendary A/V displays, this time known as [CELL]. Whichever you hit â€” The Martinez Brothers or FISHER â€” the venue will be transformed for and by the occasion in ways that would prove impossible without HÃ¯ Ibizaâ€™s benchmark-setting specifications. And thatâ€™s just in the Theatre; head to the Club Room this summer and the likes of Patrick Topping, Paco Osuna, Vintage Culture, Damian Lazarus, and Meduza & James Hype will be leading sonic journeys of their own.So, what are we looking for in a great club? Beyond the obvious, perhaps adaptability and versatility are the key ingredients. An environment made for events that could only happen in there, at that moment. And a place thatâ€™s always ready to do it all over again, only different, tomorrow night.

2	Green Valley	CamboriÃº, Brazil	10,000	greenvalleybr.com	Green Valley continues to bounce back better since it was shuttered in 2020 by a double whammy of disasters. Not only was it forced to close, alongside virtually every other club in the world, by the Covid pandemic, but a few months later it was pretty much totally destroyed by a freak cyclone. The club has now been completely rebuilt and returns to the No. 2 spot this year.The beautiful Brazilian club started out simply as a party in the jungle. Some electronic dance music fans wanted to put on a big rave in 2007, and booked none other than Carl Cox to headline in a makeshift tent on an old airfield in the heart of the huge South American country. When this event was a spectacular success, they started booking other international DJs and growing some infrastructure to begin making it into a permanent venue. Three years later it had shot into the Top 100 Clubs poll at No. 27, and by 2013 it had been voted the No. 1 club in the world! Itâ€™s remained consistently popular globally, being voted into the top three every year since 2011 â€” an amazing achievement.In the past 12 months, Green Valley has continued to transform itself internally, tweaking the layout and air-con and redesigning the VIP and backstage areas. The main stage has undergone modifications to bring performers closer to the audience in order to foster closer connections between artists and fans, and a more immersive screen has also been added in order to enhance visual effects.The club offers a sublime mixture of musical attractions. In terms of the talent, Green Valley has continued to book everyone from the biggest names to underground heroes and local sensations. In the last 12 months these have included: Peggy Gou, Duke Dumont, Meduza, Eli & Fur, Vintage Culture, ANNA, Claptone, CamelPhat, Layla Benitez, Boris Brejcha, Yotto, Tale Of Us, WhoMadeWho, Adriatique, ARTBAT, Eric Prydz and Cristoph, to name just a few.â€œAs Green Valley continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of electronic music and nightlife, one thing remains constant â€” its unwavering commitment to providing exceptional experiences for its customers,â€ says Antonio Afonso, International Managing Director of Green Valley. â€œWith its blend of stunning natural surroundings, cutting-edge technology and world-class talent, GV stands as a beacon of innovation and creativity in the global dance music scene.â€ The beautiful Brazilian club started out simply as a party in the jungle.

3	Echostage	Washington, DC, USA	3,000	echostage.com	Based in the capital of the United States, Echostage ranks among the countryâ€™s most dazzling dance venues. A former Top 100 Clubs No. 1 â€” the first North American club to claim the top spot â€” itâ€™s been in operation for 12 years, and the giant event space continues to evolve and innovate. In recent months, Echostage has had another refurb, with 130 new lighting fixtures, 56 precision beam fixtures, eight laser units, and 30 dynamic strobe fixtures, with the aim to evoke festival levels of production in an indoor space.The club sits on the site of two older venues, DC Tunnel and DC Star. Opened in 2012, itâ€™s a sprawling, 30,000-square-foot warehouse-like space, equipped with confetti cannon, lasers, cryo-jets and a 14-by-40-foot LED screen. VIPs can take advantage of its mezzanine area and bottle service tables, and thereâ€™s an d&b Audiotechnik V-Series sound system with D80 amplifiers â€” the first of its kind to be installed on Americaâ€™s East Coast â€” capable of delivering 48,000 watts of sound.In the last year, Echostage booked many of the biggest dance acts across the genre spectrum, including Tale Of Us, GRiZ, Gryffin, Charlotte de Witte, Netsky, Pendulum, The Martinez Brothers, SVDDEN DEATH, Marshmello and Black Coffee, as well as hosting the first-ever Boiler Room DC. Previous appearances at the venue include TiÃ«sto, FISHER and Timmy Trumpet, but the club is not only a magnet for prestige dance acts: pop and hip-hop royalty like Lil Yachty, Cardi B, Sam Smith, Lorde and Miley Cyrus have dropped in to grace its huge stage.Though less well-known for its dance music history than other American cities like Chicago, Detroit and New York, Washington, DC has its own bubbling scene that has given rise to everyone from Deep Dish and Beautiful Swimmers to the Black Rave Culture crew. Echostage is another vital part of the puzzle that has put the US capital on the map for clubbers.Echostage runs pre- and post-event parties for its own massive Project GLOW Festival that takes place each April in the cityâ€™s RFK Grounds, and runs Halloween-themed events in October. At the end of December each year, the club hosts Echothon, a week-long event series in the run-up to New Yearâ€™s Eve, inviting some of the biggest DJs to spark the festive atmosphere. This summer, the club will stage the debut elrow DC event in Washington, and an impressive billing of artists is already locked in for autumn.

4	UshuaÃ¯a Ibiza	Ibiza, Spain	7,700	theushuaiaexperience.comEven on an island full of clubbing mythology, UshuaÃ¯a Ibiza stands out. We've all heard the fabled story of founder Yann Pissenem stumbling on a â€œwild and almost undiscovered beachâ€ near Playa dâ€™en Bossa. A breathtaking place that invoked the end of the world, or at least the southernmost tip of Argentina, tales from the small cabana bar he launched there in 2008, and word-of-mouth free parties that sprung up right on the sand, have already been committed to the great pantheons of Balearic nightlife.Sixteen years on, or thereabouts, UshuaÃ¯a Ibiza still stands on the same stunning spot, but has grown, evolved and developed, changing the face of daytime clubbing on the island with it. Today, it is one of Ibiza's biggest and most high-profile dancefloors, a sprawling music-hotel complex with chic rooms looking out onto a beautiful beach, central pool, and iconic mainstage; focal points for some of the most in-demand day-into-evening tickets on the planet, powered by state-of-the-art sonics in the form of a razor-sharp Adamson multi-diffusion sound system. Tunes seem to follow you around every corner of the mammoth address, which is transformed for each occasion.The ideal canvas for others to realise high-concept White Isle experiences, in 2023 residencies featured some of the biggest in the business: Armin van Buuren, Calvin Harris, F*** Me Iâ€™m Famous! by David Guetta, Tomorrowland presents Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Kygo, Martin Garrix, and TiÃ«sto. Meanwhile, many of last summerâ€™s standout guests also speak to versatility; we can think of few other clubs where you might catch Steve Aoki or Skepta, Timmy Trumpet or TSHA, Afrojack or ANOTR. Other highlights, like Bicep, Peggy Gou, Mattn, Honeyluv, Monki, Maya Jane Coles, Maceo Plex, Swedish House Mafia and Eric Prydz only emphasise our point, and weâ€™ve still not mentioned ANTS.A cornerstone of this open air club since 2013, the weekly Saturday party looks deeper underground for its tech and techno soundtrack, while aesthetics nod to sci-fi surrealism beneath Balearic skies. Favourites like Andrea Oliva lead the charge from a booth that this summer will be graced by the likes of Boris Brejcha, Paul Kalkbrenner, Loco Dice, Nicole Moudaber, Mau P, Chelina Manuhutu, John Summit and more. In 2024, the new ANTS Next Gen Artist Programme will nurture raw, fresh talent, helping DJs hone skills and moulding tomorrowâ€™s prize headliners. Meanwhile, the venue itself welcomes Defected Records to the wider programme.

6	The Warehouse Project at Depot Mayfield	Manchester, England	10,000	thewarehouseproject.com	Since its inception in 2006, The Warehouse Project (WHP) has taken root in many different venues across Manchester, including its legendary stint at Store Street. In 2019, it settled into the former railway yard and Royal Mail distribution centre that is Depot Mayfield, renovating it into the mammoth multi-purpose venue that it is now. The space has kept its raw, industrial feel, with exposed bricks, concrete floors, and vast iron framework. Last season alone, WHP had the likes of Bicep, Four Tet, Leftfield, Peggy Gou, Yung Singh and Honey Dijon come through, with a star-studded list of resident DJs on rotation that include I. JORDAN, Interplanetary Criminal, Effy and Aletha. Spring this year will see the launch of a new series called ARCHIVE ONLY, where artists such as Daphni, Girls Donâ€™t Sync and East End Dubs will play in the intimate setting of the Archive room on Thursdays. The full 2024 season will return from September until New Yearâ€™s Eve; the line-ups are yet to be revealed, but expect many new club debuts as well as the return of beloved collaborators and curators. After showcases in Rotterdam and Antwerp last year, WHP will be going international again â€” and this time even further afield, programming showcases for Sydney and Melbourne in Australia this May.

7	fabric	London, UK	1,855	fabriclondon.com	Few clubs in the world are as storied as fabric. The Charterhouse Street venue, which was upgraded from a cold meat storage facility back in 1999, has been at the forefront of electronic music for almost 25 years. A staple (and previous winner) of the Top 100 Clubs poll, 2024 sees the club reclaim its place in the top 10, and itâ€™s no surprise after a year when everyone seemed to be talking about fabric. The last 12 months saw a redesign of the iconic main entrance, and the opening of a new shop selling pizza, soft drinks, music and merch. Bookings, as always, included the cream of the underground, alongside residents Craig Richards, Terry Francis, Anna Wall, Bobby., Harry McCanna, Hutch, Jaden Thompson and Josh CaffÃ©. The fabric, FABRICLIVE and Continuum events have been joined by new Sunday series C.A.Y.A. (Come As You Are), and Love Hertz, which launched with a show at St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral. But the big focus now is the 25th anniversary year, with the past, present and future of fabric coming together via the Invites series, where long-term collaborators are given the chance to curate club nights, a run of takeovers at other clubs like Fuse, Tresor and Lux Fragil, and six events curated by Craig Richards.

8	Amnesia	Ibiza, Spain	3,900		amnesia.es Amnesia lies on the road connecting the busy areas of Ibiza Town in the southeast to San Antonio in the west. Despite its relative distance to the main action, the islandâ€™s original superclub continues to pull more than its weight. From its early days as a countercultural haven and then hub for Balearic pioneers, to its shift as a global player with the explosion of rave culture, the club has outlived many of its peers, continuing to pull in new generations of talent. Carl Cox, Sven VÃ¤th, Chase & Status and Skrillex have all spun in one of its two rooms, while Underworld, Public Enemy and 50 Cent have performed live on its stages. It also remains a key attraction for well-known faces â€” Naomi Campbell, Cristiano Ronaldo and Leonardo DiCaprio have been spotted at the iconic location. But itâ€™s the clubâ€™s attention to detail, from its residency programming to party curation, thatâ€™s kept it relevant to new waves of electronic music lovers. This year's opening party includes sets from top-tier DJs such as Dennis Cruz, Green Velvet, Honey Dijon and Nina Kraviz. Jamie Jones will continue to host his Paradise series there too â€”â€¯not to mention the legendary Do Not Sleep and elrow parties. Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.

Often this has been through the venueâ€™s own curated Law Of The Jungle series, but brands such elrow have also been queuing up to host their own events. â€œWe're thankful to the people of Bali for their warmth and vibrant culture, which inspire our team to deliver unforgettable experiences at Sayava,â€ founder Alex Cordova says. â€œBali is evolving from a tropical paradise into a global music destination. As Bali embraces its role as a future entertainment hub, we aim to follow suit, captivating and energising guests by seamlessly blending culture, luxury and excitement to create unparalleled entertainment."

12	Noa Beach Club	ZrÄ‡e Beach, Croatia	4,000	noa-beach.com	Noa Beach Club has been a steady fixture in the upper regions of our poll for several years now and it's not hard to see why. It is one of the shining lights of its native Croatian scene and a real anchor point for many of the summer's largest and most internationally renowned festivals. Events have included collaborations with legendary Ibiza club Amnesia and festivals like Oasis, hard dance smasher Forbidden Island, Hideout, and many more. Every year, the venue looks to raise the bar in terms of the DJs it offers for standalone parties, and in the last 12 months big names like MORTEN, Cuebrick and Vize have all left their mark, while well-known regional resident DJs Lorenzo, Mike & Me and NOIDE are amongst some of those with ever-growing profiles. As well as the music, the clubâ€™s location on the famous ZrÄ‡e Beach on the Island of Pag makes Noa irresistible; it is built off the beach and over the Adriatic sea, with several different dancefloors and bars, a pool, chillout cabanas, palm trees, and huge sound systems all in and amongst organic and bohemian design features. It's a perfect open-air and sun-kissed beach club, frankly, and high rollers can even pull up to it by boat. Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
13	Berghain	Berlin, Germany	1,500		berghain.de Thereâ€™s more to Berghain than its eponymous main room. The club encompasses many different spaces: Panorama Bar, Kantine am Berghain, Halle, Lab.oratory, and SaÃ¼le. During the summer, the Garten provides a dusty, sun-drenched spot, brought to life by house DJs playing in the outdoor DJ booth. Inside, the industrial-style Berghain room has seen a range of talents play its fabled Funktion-One sound system, from Freddy K to Tasha to DJ Rolando. Upstairs, in Panorama Bar, brighter textures dominate the high-ceilinged space, with Avalon Emerson, Batu, Gabrielle Kwarteng and many more keeping the party going till Monday morning. Over the last 12 months, Berghain and Panorama Bar have hosted several label showcases and collectives. Darwinâ€™s bass-fuelled REEF rumbled both floors, Sedef AdasÃ¯ brought her HAMAM Nights to Panorama Bar, Marie Montexier curated a PARYÃ¬A showcase, and Lolsnake took their party weeeirdos to Berghain. Long-running events like Finest Thursday, Finest Friday, Snax, and the annual Silvester Klubnacht marathon on New Yearâ€™s Eve remain regular fixtures in the clubâ€™s calendar.

14	Zouk Singapore	Singapore	2,900	zoukclub.com	Singapore's Zouk club has long been one of the leading lights in Asia. It is a club that is about so much more than big names â€” a night in the custom-built premises in Clarke Quay is a chance to explore four very different and distinctive clubs in one. The main space holds 1,900 ravers and offers a mix of neo-industrial and futuristic aesthetics that tap into influences taken from original warehouse parties in Berlin and New York. Spread over two floors and vast in scale, it is hard not to be impressed by the affectionately nicknamed lighting rig, called The Mothership, and the exposed concrete and rusted metal that grows up all around you as the beats rain down with great clarity from a custom sound system designed by audio engineer, Gary Stewart. Elsewhere you can explore more intimate surroundings in the 250-capacity Phuture, and enjoy a mix of hip-hop, breaks, and drum & bass; or chill out in the more stylised lounge setting of Capital, which holds just over 500 people and boasts multiple bars. Musically, Zouk hosts the most renowned names from the worlds of prog, trance and house, with the Anjunadeep crew, Miss Monique and Paul van Dyk having all left their mark in the last 12 months.

All these years on, it is world-renowned as a key part of one of Europe's biggest summer festival operations. Originally a public waterslide site bordered by pebble beaches, Papaya Club boasts an open-air layout that allows guests to dance beneath the stars or the sun, just a few steps away from the Adriatic Sea. Its distinctive, shell-like main stage is complemented by a massive LED screen setup, while the pools host many daily and nightly parties, as well as festivals like Hideout, Sonus and Barrakud. Over the past year, the club has undergone significant enhancements, including the refurbishment of its VIP pool party area, which offers exclusive views and intimate spaces to chill away from the main action. The list of artists who have played in the last 12 months is long and impressive, with stars from across house and techno â€” like Deborah De Luca, GORDO, Marco Carola, The Martinez Brothers, and Meduza â€” gracing the decks.

16	Play House	Chengdu, China	1,000	instagram.com/playhousechina	Chengduâ€™s PLAY HOUSE â€” the third of three PLAY HOUSE nightclub venues in China â€” makes a strong showing in the DJ Mag Top 100 Clubs poll for the fourth year running. Following their relocation in 2022 to an opulent former theatre building, PLAY HOUSE Chengdu is a huge venue that comes in at 7,500 square metres, and is an imposing 30 metres high inside. Itâ€™s split into three main spaces that include substantial breakout VIP lounges, and it also has a recording studio attached. The club is fitted with a super-clean L-Acoustics pro audio sound system and features jaw-dropping immersive audio/visual sync tech throughout, making it ideal not only for regular club nights, but also extravagant events like their Mid-Autumn Festival, which showcases new electronic music. PLAY HOUSE Chengdu uses its cavernous space and impressive production stages to great effect, specialising in no-holds-barred, high-production nights soundtracked by the big room sounds of EDM, electro house and trance, and in 2023 the club hosted appearances from DJ talent including Steve Aoki, Armin van Buuren, KSHMR, Zabo, MORTEN, Mike Williams and Alchimyst, supported by their resident DJ, Miss Ann.

17	Fabrik	Madrid, Spain	6,000	fabrikclub.com	More reminiscent of a gigantic warehouse complex than a club, Madridâ€™s FABRIK is massive in every sense. Split over six distinct areas â€” the capacious Main Room, Open Air, more intimate Hangar, Satellite, Club and Crystal â€” and an outdoor stage, it even has its own hotel attached. FABRIKâ€™s L-Acoustics sound system and location outside city limits ensure the volume gets cranked to the maximum, and style-wise, the club runs the gamut. So far in 2024, itâ€™s hosted the Twist DNB XXL Festival with drum & bass bigwigs like Camo & Krooked, Black Sun Empire and Netsky, legends such as Dave Clarke, Len Faki and Ken Ishii, and tech-house from the elrow crew, while its promotions 150 and Code cater to hardstyle and techno heads respectively.Â This month, DJ Bone, Amelie Lens and Ben Sims play the Code party, while Technasia and Mason Collective are coming up later in spring.

18	Ministry Of Sound	London, UK	1,600	ministryofsound.com	Now gearing up for its 33rd anniversary, Londonâ€™s iconic Ministry of Sound (MoS) nightclub remains a place to be â€” one that persists in bending and tweaking, listening and learning from its followers and attendees. In the last 12 months, three of its four rooms have been given a big overhaul, with interiors stripped back to reveal the clubâ€™s original structure, DJ booths lowered to the ground, and a massive bar installed in The Loft. In short, the whole gaff has been re-engineered from a once bus garage to an impressive place that its dancers can always call home. Sound design as ever takes its place at the forefront of what makes MoS tick, with MoS kitted out with a bass-enhanced Martin Audio system. Even the entrance tunnel has ambient music pumped through on your way in. New alliances have been formed with NTS, Deviation and La Fiesta, and this year the likes of Dimitri From Paris and Bob Sinclar join up-and-comers Ammara, DAIRE and Demi RiquÃ­simo, along with mainstays and co-promoters Piano People, Jungle Mania, Future Disco, Backto95 and Melting Pot. And, interestingly, as well as launching a new website, MoS has commissioned its own fragrance courtesy of Parisian master perfumer, Mark Buxton. Very fancy indeed.

19	Studio 338	London, UK	2,500		studio338.co.uk Londonâ€™s Studio 338 celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2023. Situated on the Greenwich Peninsula, nowadays itâ€™s a clubbing haven with five rooms, including the famed Terrace â€” one of the largest indoor terraces in Europe, in fact â€” equipped with a spectacular glass ceiling and Void sound system, and the outdoor Garden, with stunning views of Londonâ€™s skyline and a chillout zone. Thereâ€™s a VIP area for those who want a different clubbing experience than the frenzy of crowds, with a balcony overlooking the dancefloor and its own private bar and terrace area. Thereâ€™s a second room in the Loft thatâ€™s considered the place for techno, and a basement-style room called Overflow. The main Terrace is rigged with a futuristic lighting system called THE GRID.

20	PACHA IBIZA	Ibiza, Spain	3903	pacha.com	From its humble beginnings back in the early â€™70s as a traditional Ibizan farmhouse in the wetlands of Talamanca, Pacha Ibiza has grown into one of the worldâ€™s most iconic clubs. The venue now boasts a 2,600-square-metre main room, a second room and restaurant, and numerous outdoor spaces. Aside from the small matter of celebrating the clubâ€™s 50th birthday in 2023, the Pacha Ibiza team also found time to renovate the VIP area, and upgrade the already impressive dynamic visual installation in the main room, doubling the LED screenâ€™s previous resolution â€” and theyâ€™re installing a further huge video wall too. Itâ€™s party time seven nights a week at Pacha through summer, including CamelPhat on Tuesdays, Marco Carolaâ€™s Music On on Fridays and Solomunâ€™s +1 Sunday session, and over the last 12 months the club has booked a range of DJs from Moodyman, Peggy Gou, Honey Dijon and Luciano to Fatboy Slim, Steve Angelo and Pete Tong. Together with Pacha Ibizaâ€™s other residents â€” Bedouin, Robin Schulz, Purple Disco Machine, Diplo, Hugel, Lost Frequencies and Bora Uzer â€” the club will be kicking off the 2024 season with a series of one-off events with, to name a few, WhoMadeWho, Ben BÃ¶hmer, Roger Sanchez, Loco Dice, Keinemusik, KÃ¶lsch and Ida Engberg, before heading into another no doubt killer summer season.

21	Cavo Paradiso	Mykonos Island, Greece	3,000		cavoparadiso.gr Mykonos is known for many things, from its paradisal beaches to its luxury hotels, but one of the most unique enclaves on the island is Cavo Paradiso. The club blends the beauty of Mykonosâ€™ landscape with electronic sounds, hosting the finest names in dance music since 1993. Peggy Gou, David Morales, Steve Aoki, and many more have graced the near-mystical space in the last 12 months alone. Nestled in a 100-foot cliff overlooking the crystalline waters of the Aegean, Cavo Paradiso lives up to its name. With an open-air dancefloor and Funktion-One sound system, everything about it feels pristine. Headed up by Stathis Lazarides, Coolis Kalopetris and Lorenzo Papachrisanthou, Cavo Paradiso is in capable and considerate hands. â€œThe scene would not survive if it was just festivals,â€ Lazarides told DJ Mag in an interview this year. â€œClubs are incredibly important, everything started from the clubs. So places like Cavo remaining healthy is really important, for the scene as a whole.â€ Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
22	Avant Gardner & The Brooklyn Mirage	Brooklyn, NY, USA	8,000+	avant-gardner.com	Mentions of award-winning production, KV2 sound systems, multiple stages, and back-to-back line-ups featuring the worldâ€™s largest DJs might conjure thoughts of a fully fledged music festival, but thereâ€™s a venue in Brooklyn that boasts all these elements and more. Weâ€™re talking about the Avant Gardner complex in Bushwickâ€™s industrial zone, and its seasonal mammoth, The Brooklyn Mirage. Accommodating more than 8,000 club-goers, this sprawling destination spans a full city block, and offers all of the amenities for day-into-night clubbing, including three distinct spaces, six bars, a food court, and North Americaâ€™s largest 15k-resolution LED wall, measuring in at 200 by 30 feet. During cooler months, the more intimate Kings Hall and the masterfully rigged Great Hall deliver a premier megaclub experience in NYC, but during summertime the good vibes flow into the four-storey, outdoor Brooklyn Mirage, which is soon set to welcome Armin van Buurren, Carl Cox, Keinemusik, REZZ and any other massive act youâ€™re likely to imagine. Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
23	Surreal Park	CamboriÃº, Brazil	20,000		surreal.art.br Dreamt up by Renato Ratier, Surreal Park is set over 102,000 square metres in the south of Brazil, and it lives up to its name with five distinctive dancefloors. At Bells â€” also known as the techno barn â€” a huge bell hangs over the DJ booth, and there are goats up in the roof. Later in the year the venue opens JETSET, a new stage built around the body of a Boeing 727-200. And this summer it hosted an outdoor stage, Ritual, inspired by Ratier`s 2023 album of the same name, which had a capacity of over 10,000 people. Small wonder then that Surreal Park welcomed 160 artists in 2023, including Loco Dice, Nina Kraviz, Seth Troxler, Boys Noize, Mind Against, Dixon, Stephan Bodzin, Carl Cox and Black Coffee. While floods and currency depreciation made it a tough year for the club and the country in general, Surreal Park was also able to draw on its loyal clubbers to organise food and clothing collection campaigns for those in need.  Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
24	Academy LA	Los Angeles, CA, USA	1,500		academy.la Nestled in the heart of Los Angeles, Academy LA is the latest incarnation of a venue that has previously been known as Create Nightclub, Vanguard, and Qtopia. It has been under the auspices of Insomniac Events since 2018, however, and made huge strides with its state-of-the-art Funktion-One sound system. The club's dynamic line-up of events showcases an eclectic mix of world-renowned artists, from Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike to Alan Walker, and includes nights such as Dreamstate for trance, Factory 93 for underground sounds, Bassrush for bass, Lost in Dreams for melodic, Basscon for hardstyle, and Day Trip for house music.

Originally a 16th-century medieval bastion, over the past year it has undergone significant upgrades to its state-of-the-art lighting and video effects, dynamic LED displays and captivating laser shows. The club attracts top-tier talent across the house and techno spectrum, like Dubfire, Mood II Swing and Sasha, and hosts parties every night of the week. Resident DJs like BoZZo and DJ Speed keep the local scene thriving, and there are plenty of plans afoot to keep the venue right at the cutting edge, with the incorporation of new production technologies that make use of artificial intelligence and holographic solutions. All of that should help keep it right at the forefront of destination nightclubs both nationally and internationally. Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
26	DC-10	Ibiza, Spain	1,500	instagram.com/dc10ibizaofficial	An old farmhouse turned top-tier club situated between Ibiza Town and Playa dâ€™en Bossa, DC-10 remains one of the most storied spaces on the White Isle. Its proximity to the airport adds a dystopian feel (in a good way) as the best of house and techno talents upend the main terrace and outdoor area, its Void Acoustics system drowning out the noise of aeroplanes just overhead. On Monday nights, Circoloco reigns supreme, booking artists like Hot Since 82, FJAAK, ChloÃ© Caillet, Peach, and many more. Michael Bibi and PAWSAâ€™s Solid Grooves and Amelie Lensâ€™ EXHALE are two globally renowned brands that also take over the club in the summer months, affirming DC-10â€™s diverse music policy and multi-faceted creative direction, from sunny tech-house to dark techno. While there are several superclubs dotted across the island, DC-10 will always be a more intimate and inviting spot, reflecting the magic and allure Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
27	Exchange LA	Los Angeles, CA, USA	1,000	exchangela.com	 With its art deco filigree, marble flourishes, seven bars, extravagant lighting system and 30-by-40-foot LED screen, Exchange LA â€” in a former life, the 1930s-era Los Angeles Stock Exchange â€” certainly looks the part of a Top 100 club. With its Funktion-One system, it sounds like one as well. But the proof of the pleasure palaceâ€™s status comes via those who have played there, thanks in large part to a longstanding partnership with Insomniac Events. With a slew of nights dedicated to specific genres (bass music, house, techno, hardstyle, reggaeton and more), that list takes in a wide swathe of artists, with names like The Martinez Brothers, Gorgon City, Armin van Buuren, Above & Beyond, Charlotte de Witte and Chase & Status just a few of those to have graced the Exchange decks in the past. The club is currently closed for renovations and improvements, with a redesign of the video and lighting layout in the works as well, ensuring artists of that calibre will continue to pack the kids into the downtown LA standby.

28	The Concourse Project	Austin, TX	2,000	concourseproject.com	No two visits to The Concourse Project are quite the same â€” and according to founders Andrew Parsons and Kelly Gray of RealMusic Events, and their creative partner and co-founder, David Brinkley â€” thatâ€™s the allure. â€œA key element of The Concourse Project is that we update our production and lighting rig throughout the year to enhance experiences and keep things fresh,â€ Gray explains. â€œWe make edits or add new touches all around and the community feels a part of the journey, the ever-evolving project.â€ And what an evolution itâ€™s been! Since opening in 2021, the 18,000-square-foot warehouse set on 15 acres has become a cornerstone of Austinâ€™s electronic scene, hosting 2,000-cap shows and intimate club nights, while each fall, serving as the centerpiece for the three-stage festival, Seismic Dance Event. Outfitted with a d&b Audiotechnik sound system in its main room (and an authentic taco trailer on the patio!) this scalable, modular space suits underground acts and scene titans alike, such as Purple Disco Machine, TiÃ«sto and Wax Motif, who will appear there in the coming months.

29	ShiShi Bali	Bali, Indonesia	1,000	shishibali.com	Following its first entry in the poll last year, ShiShi Bali returns for its second year running, and itâ€™s no surprise considering its fast-growing reputation as a lush and lavish clubbing experience in Indonesia. Open seven days a week, the cocktail bar, restaurant and nightclub sprawls across three floors. Styled with a blend of boho aesthetics and futuristic design, complemented by an innovative lighting and sound system, ShiShi evokes an other-worldly atmosphere just a 10-minute stroll from Petitenget Beach. With a dress code of â€œupscale fashionableâ€, ShiShi is the kind of place for a special occasion, enhanced by its extensive music policy. Itâ€™s a more relaxed affair in the Izakaya Lounge, while the second floor channels high-energy EDM. On the top floor, R&B pumps from the state-of-the-art sound system well into the early hours. Artists like Sheila Marcia, Lizzy Wang, P.Joana and many more have recently headlined the club.  Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.

31	Lost Beach Club	MontaÃ±ita, Ecuador	2,500	instagram.com/lostbeachclub	Lost Beach, the clubbing oasis in the town of MontaÃ±ita on the Ecuadorian coast, has become used to thriving in adversity, overcoming obstacles to put on parties often against the odds. The latest tricky situation is the small matter of martial law being imposed in Ecuador by new president Daniel Noboa in January, in an attempt to combat drug gangs. Despite this, and various curfews in 2023, Lost Beach still managed to host the likes of Mochakk, Apollonia, wAFF, Franky Rizardo, Solardo, Josh Butler, Yousef, Latmun and Doc Martin last year, an epic 80-hour Taraka event helmed by GORDO, and the week-long Trotamindo festival â€” co-organised by Un_Mute from Miami â€” which foregrounded underground DJs, â€œhelping us find our identity again since tech-house, which was mostly played at the club these past few years, has become so commercial,â€ Lost Beach head honcho Kami tells DJ Mag.

Growing from a small venue via a process of constantly tweaking small details to continually improve the experience at the venue, Wave Club is now a quality rave space fitted out with a pristine Funktion-One sound system, a soundproofed VIP area, and a long outdoor terrace. The venue runs themed events and local artists during the week, with major club nights taking place on Fridays and Saturdays.

Thrust Publishing Ltd, Unit 3, 30-40 Underwood Street, London, N1 7JQ, United Kingdom.
33	Motion	Bristol, UK	4,000	motion-bristol.com	Motion has aged well. It used to be enough for the skatepark-turned-warehouse venue to rely on little more than its austere appearance, big DJ bookings and Funktion-One speakers. But that was pre-pandemic, and Motion has since had to fight for its survival by inviting more live acts to perform there, making better use of its space, and winning the right to keep its noise levels the same. The teamâ€™s hard work has paid off, and as of last year, Motion was able to relaunch its In:Motion series, which books some of dance musicâ€™s most sought-after DJs. Garage legend DJ EZ, Canadaâ€™s Jayda G, and rising star Oâ€™Flynn are just a few recent highlights.Â Â A manager for the club said that now the team are working to make Motion an even more immersive clubbing experience, with a 360Âº stage and ceiling screens, while also looking at how they can use Motionâ€™s worldwide renown to encourage revellers to attend other grassroots venues around the city.

34	Watergate	Berlin, Germany	800		water-gate.de Berlinâ€™s Watergate lies on the southside of the Oberbaum Bridge, an unlikely oasis with an iconic view overlooking the River Spree. It opened its doors over two decades ago and in the years since has played a key part in nurturing upcoming talent, from Anja Schneider and Dixon to megastar Solomun.

68	Rex Club	Paris, France	800	rexclub.com	Rex Club started out in the 1930s as an art deco cinema.

In 2023, it collaborated with more than 1,000 artists, booking DJs from across the spectrum â€” Ben Sims, Dr. Rubinstein, Interplanetary Criminal, LSDXOXO, Octave One, Paula Temple and UNIIQU3 all played its hallowed halls â€”â€¯and did away with the resident DJ role, opting instead to work with a wider roster of DJs from across the Spanish scene.
